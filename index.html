				<span class="tooltip">
					<span class="top">Abstract: </span>
					<span class="middle">
                                                We propose a mechanism design framework that incorporates both soft information, which can be freely manipulated, 
                                                and semi-hard information, which entails a cost for falsification. The framework captures various contexts such 
                                                as school choice, public housing, organ transplant and manipulations of classification algorithms. We first 
                                                provide a canonical class of mechanisms for these settings. The key idea is to treat the submission of hard 
                                                information as an observable and payoff-relevant action and the contractible part of the mechanism as a mapping 
                                                from submitted scores to a distribution over decisions (a score-based decision rule). Each type report triggers 
                                                a distribution over score submission requests and a distribution over decision rules. We provide conditions under 
                                                which score-based mechanisms are without loss of generality. In other words, situations under which the agent does 
                                                not make any type reports and decides without a mediator what score to submit in a score-based decision rule. We 
                                                proceed to characterize optimal approval mechanisms in the presence of manipulable hard information. In several 
                                                leading settings optimal mechanisms are score-based (and thus do not rely on soft information) and involve costly 
                                                screening. The solution methodology we employ is suitable both for concave cost functions and quadratic costs and 
                                                is applicable to a wide range of contexts in economics and in computer science.

					<span class="middle">
                                        Relying on manipulable characteristics to target the allocation of resources is problematic. Naively optimal 
                                        rules lead to falsification and allocative inefficiency. Optimizing the rule for allocative efficiency while 
                                        accounting for falsification typically induces rather than eliminates falsification, at a heavy cost to the agents. 
                                        Furthermore, falsification causes fairness concerns and negative social externalities. We show that optimal 
                                        falsification-proof rules offer a viable alternative, eliminating negative externalities and, under some conditions 
                                        on the falsification technology, significantly improving the agents' welfare, at a low cost in allocative efficiency. 
                                        To do so, we characterize optimal falsification-proof rules under a rich variety of falsification technologies. We also 
                                        examine the impact of demographic changes on allocations within and across identifiable groups, under resource and quota 
                                        constraints.

                                        We study how to optimally design mechanisms for allocating scarce resources, accounting for agentsâ€™ 
                                        investment incentives. A principal wishes to allocate a resource of homogeneous quality, such as seats 
                                        in a university, to a heterogeneous population of agents. She commits ex-ante to a possibly random 
                                        allocation rule that depends on a one-dimensional characteristic of the agents that she intrinsically 
                                        values, but does not have access to monetary transfers. Agents have a strict preference to be allocated 
                                        the resource and may undertake a costly investment to improve their characteristic before it is 
                                        revealed to the principal. We show that while random allocation rules have the effect of encouraging 
                                        investment, especially at the top of the characteristic distribution, deterministic pass-fail 
                                        allocation rules, such as exams with a pass grade, prove to be optimal.

                                        A principal designs an information structure and chooses transfers to an agent that are contingent on 
                                        the action of a receiver. The principal faces a trade-off between, on the one hand, designing an 
                                        information structure maximizing non-monetary payoffs, and on the other hand, minimizing the information rent that must be 
                                        conceded to the agent in order to implement the information structure which the principal designed. We

                                         firms and the companies marketing their products, consultancies and the analysts they employ.

                                        We consider a general information design problem in which the task of running a procedure generating 
                                        information for a continuation game is performed by an agent. A moral hazard problem therefore emerges 
                                        in which the principal faces a trade-off between generating information that is persuasive in the

					We study the optimal design of tests with manipulable inputs. Tests take a unidimensional state of the 
                                        world as input, and output an informative signal to guide a receiver's approve or reject decision. The 
                                        receiver wishes to only approve states that comply with her baseline standard. An agent with a 
                                        preference for approval can covertly falsify the state of the world at a cost. We characterize 
                                        receiver-optimal tests and show they rely on productive falsification by compliant states. They work by 
                                        setting a more stringent operational standard, and granting noncompliant states a positive approval 
                                        probability to deter them from falsifying to the standard. We also study how falsification-detection 
                                        technologies improve optimal tests. They allow the designer to build an implicit cost of falsification 
                                        into the test, in the form of signal devaluations. Exploiting this channel requires enriching the 
                                        signal space.

                                        embedded in a fixed network and care about each other. We explore whether altruistic transfers help 
                                        smooth consumption and how this depends on the shape of the network. We find that altruism networks 
                                        have a first-order impact on risk. Altruistic transfers generate efficient insurance when the network 
                                        of perfect altruistic ties is strongly connected. We uncover two specific empirical implications of 
                                        altruism networks. First, bridges can generate good overall risk sharing and, more generally, the 
                                        quality of informal insurance depends on the average path length of the network. Second, large shocks 
                                        are well-insured by connected altruism networks. By contrast, large shocks tend to be badly insured in 
                                        models of informal insurance with frictions. We characterize what happens for shocks that leave the 
                                        structure of giving relationships unchanged. We further explore the relationship between consumption 
                                        variance and centrality, correlation in consumption streams across agents and the impact of adding links.

                                        We study a class of sender-receiver disclosure games in the lab. Our experiment relies on a graphical 
                                        representation of sender's incentives in these games, and permits partial disclosure. We use local and 
                                        global properties of the incentive graph to explain behavior and performance of players across different
                                        games. Sender types whose interests are aligned with those of the receiver fully disclose, while other 
                                        types use vague messages. Receivers take the evidence disclosed by senders into account, and perform 
                                        better in games with an acyclic graph. Senders perform better in games with a cyclic graph. The data is 
                                        largely consistent with a non-equilibrium model of strategic thinking based on the iterated elimination 
                                        of obviously dominated strategies.

                                        We provide the first analysis of altruism in networks. Agents are embedded in a fixed network and care 
                                        about the well-being of their network neighbors. Depending on incomes, they may provide financial 
                                        support to their poorer friends. We study the Nash equilibria of the resulting game of transfers. We 
                                        show that equilibria maximize a concave potential function. We establish existence, uniqueness of 
                                        equilibrium consumption and generic uniqueness of equilibrium transfers. We characterize the geometry 
                                        of the network of transfers and highlight the key role played by transfer intermediaries. We then study
					comparative statics. A positive income shock to an individual benefits all. For small changes in incomes, 
                                        agents in a component of the network of transfers act as if they were organized in an income-pooling 
                                        community. A decrease in income inequality or expansion of the altruistic network may increase 
                                        consumption inequality.

                                        This paper makes a first attempt at building a theory of interim Bayesian persuasion. I work in a 
                                        minimalist model where a low or high type sender seeks validation from a receiver who is willing to 
                                        validate high types exclusively. After learning her type, the sender chooses a complete conditional 
                                        information structure for the receiver from a possibly restricted feasible set. I suggest a solution to 
                                        this game that takes into account the signaling potential of the sender's choice.

                                        This article asks when communication with certifiable information leads to complete information 
                                        revelation. We consider Bayesian games augmented by a pre-play communication phase in which 
                                        announcements are made publicly. We first characterize the augmented games in which there exists a 
                                        fully revealing sequential equilibrium with extremal beliefs (i.e., any deviation is attributed to a 
                                        single type of the deviator). Next, we define a class of games for which existence of a fully revealing 
                                        equilibrium is equivalent to a richness property of the evidence structure. This characterization 
                                        enables us to provide different sets of sufficient conditions for full information disclosure that 
                                        encompass and extend all known results in the literature, and are easily applicable. We use these 
                                        conditions to obtain new insights in persuasion games with multidimensional types, games with strategic 
                                        complementarities, and voting with deliberation.

                                        Paul Milgrom (2010) proposes to simplify mechanisms by restricting their message space. When doing so, 
                                        it is important not to create new equilibria. A weakly tight simplification is one that does not create 
                                        new Nash equilibria, a tight simplification is one that does not create new &epsilon;-Nash equilibria. 
                                        This note offers characterizations of tightness. When the preference domain is that of continuous 
                                        utility functions on the outcome space, the two notions are equivalent, and are also equivalent to the 
                                        outcome closure property of Milgrom (2008).

                                        This note gives a new proof of Blackwell's celebrated result. The result is a bit stronger than the 
                                        classical version since the action set and the prior are fixed, and only the utility of the decision 
                                        maker varies. I show directly that a decision maker has access to a larger set of joint distributions 
                                        over actions and states of the world if and only if her information improves in the garbling order.

                                        This paper addresses a common criticism of certification processes: that they simultaneously generate 
                                        excessive complexity, insufficient scrutiny and high rates of undue validation. We build a model of 
                                        persuasion in which low and high types pool on their choice of complexity. A natural criterion based on 
                                        forward induction selects the high-type optimal pooling equilibrium.When the receiver prefers rejection 
                                        ex ante, the sender simplifies her report. When the receiver prefers validation ex ante, however, more 
                                        complexity makes the receiver less selective, and we provide sufficient conditions that lead to 
                                        complexity inflation in equilibrium.

                                        This paper studies strategic disclosure between multiple senders and a single receiver. The senders are 
                                        competing for prizes awarded by the receiver. They decide whether to disclose a piece of information 
                                        that is both verifiable and equivocal (it can influence the receiver both ways). Then the standard 
                                        unraveling argument breaks down: if the commonly known probability that her information is favorable is 
                                        sufficiently high, a single sender never discloses. Competition restores full disclosure only if some of 
                                        the senders are sufficiently unlikely to have favorable information. When the senders are uncertain 
                                        about each other's strength, however, all symmetric equilibria approach full disclosure as the number of 
                                        candidates increases.
