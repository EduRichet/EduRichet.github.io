                Information structures shape the possible outcomes of strategic interactions as agents learn from, and respond to the signals 
                they receive. Often, however, agents can also respond to the conditions of information production before any information is even 
                generated. When their interests are at stakes, agents may try to interfere with the production of information, or preemptively 
                change the underlying reality for fear of what might be revealed. For example, reporting on the practices of firms may lead 
                them both to opt for cleaner production processes or engage in greenwashing. The IMEDMC project seeks to advance our 
                understanding of the effect of information structures in situations where agents respond both before and after information is 
                produced.

					<span class="middle">
                                                We propose a mechanism design framework that incorporates both soft information, which can be freely manipulated, 
                                                and semi-hard information, which entails a cost for falsification. The framework captures various contexts such 
                                                as school choice, public housing, organ transplant and manipulations of classification algorithms. We first 
                                                provide a canonical class of mechanisms for these settings. The key idea is to treat the submission of hard 
                                                information as an observable and payoff-relevant action and the contractible part of the mechanism as a mapping 
                                                from submitted scores to a distribution over decisions (a score-based decision rule). Each type report triggers 
                                                a distribution over score submission requests and a distribution over decision rules. We provide conditions under 
                                                which score-based mechanisms are without loss of generality. In other words, situations under which the agent does 
                                                not make any type reports and decides without a mediator what score to submit in a score-based decision rule. We 
                                                proceed to characterize optimal approval mechanisms in the presence of manipulable hard information. In several 
                                                leading settings optimal mechanisms are score-based (and thus do not rely on soft information) and involve costly 
                                                screening. The solution methodology we employ is suitable both for concave cost functions and quadratic costs and 
                                                is applicable to a wide range of contexts in economics and in computer science.

					<span class="middle">
                                        Relying on manipulable characteristics to target the allocation of resources is problematic. Naively optimal 
                                        rules lead to falsification and allocative inefficiency. Optimizing the rule for allocative efficiency while 
                                        accounting for falsification typically induces rather than eliminates falsification, at a heavy cost to the agents. 
                                        Furthermore, falsification causes fairness concerns and negative social externalities. We show that optimal 
                                        falsification-proof rules offer a viable alternative, eliminating negative externalities and, under some conditions 
                                        on the falsification technology, significantly improving the agents' welfare, at a low cost in allocative efficiency. 
                                        To do so, we characterize optimal falsification-proof rules under a rich variety of falsification technologies. We also 
                                        examine the impact of demographic changes on allocations within and across identifiable groups, under resource and quota 
                                        constraints.

                                        We study the optimal design of tests with manipulable inputs. Tests take a unidimensional state of the 
                                        world as input, and output an informative signal to guide a receiver's approve or reject decision. The 
                                        receiver wishes to only approve states that comply with her baseline standard. An agent with a 
                                        preference for approval can covertly falsify the state of the world at a cost. We characterize 
                                        receiver-optimal tests and show they rely on productive falsification by compliant states. They work 
                                        by setting a more stringent operational standard, and granting noncompliant states a positive approval 
                                        probability to deter them from falsifying to the standard. We also study how falsification-detection 
                                        technologies improve optimal tests. They allow the designer to build an implicit cost of falsification 
                                        into the test, in the form of signal devaluations. Exploiting this channel requires enriching the 
                                        signal space.

                We study optimal contracts for delegated information design: the principal must rely on an agent to design or implement some

                end of the informational process.

                                        A principal designs an information structure and chooses transfers to an agent that are contingent on 
                                        the action of a receiver. The principal faces a trade-off between, on the one hand, designing an 
                                        information structure maximizing non-monetary payoffs, and on the other hand, minimizing the

                                        which the principal designed. We examine how this trade-off shapes communication. Our model can be 
                                        applied to study the relationship between, e.g.: political organizations and the public relations

                                        We consider a general information design problem in which the task of running a procedure generating
                                        information for a continuation game is performed by an agent. A moral hazard problem therefore emerges 
                                        in which the principal faces a trade-off between generating information that is persuasive in the 
                                        continuation game, and efficiently in- centivizing the agent to comply with the procedure designed. 
                                        Standard concavification techniques do not apply in this environment. We provide a general methodology 
                                        to tackle such problems, and examine the way in which moral hazard affects the optimal procedure of the

                                        We study how to optimally design mechanisms for allocating scarce resources, accounting for agents’ 
                                        investment incentives. A principal wishes to allocate a resource of homogeneous quality, such as seats 
                                        in a university, to a heterogeneous population of agents. She commits ex-ante to a possibly random 
                                        allocation rule that depends on a one-dimensional characteristic of the agents that she intrinsically 
                                        values, but does not have access to monetary transfers. Agents have a strict preference to be allocated 
                                        the resource and may undertake a costly investment to improve their characteristic before it is 
                                        revealed to the principal. We show that while random allocation rules have the effect of encouraging 
                                        investment, especially at the top of the characteristic distribution, deterministic pass-fail 
                                        allocation rules, such as exams with a pass grade, prove to be optimal.

                                        Consumer data can be used to sort consumers into different market segments, allowing a monopolist to 
                                        charge different prices at each segment. We study consumer-optimal segmentations with redistributive 
                                        concerns, i.e., that prioritize poorer consumers. Such segmentations are efficient but may grant 
                                        additional profits to the monopolist, compared to consumer-optimal segmentations with no redistributive 
                                        concerns. We characterize the markets for which this is the case and provide a procedure for 
                                        constructing optimal segmentations given a strong redistributive motive. For the remaining markets, we 
                                        show that the optimal segmentation is surprisingly simple: it generates one segment with a discount 
                                        price and one segment with the same price that would be charged if there were no segmentation.

                                        To what extent should platforms enable price discrimination by sellers when buyers
                                        can vote with their feet? I assume that buyers are endowed with an outside option and
                                        a belief about their valuation before they decide whether to participate in the platform
                                        or not. For the platform, endogenous participation creates a trade-off between surplus
                                        extraction and participation. It also imposes a constraint: when participation increases
                                        with valuations, the segmentation rules that deliver the highest buyer surplus under
                                        full participation cannot be implemented. I characterize the feasible welfare frontier
                                        and derive the platform’s optimal segmentation under three alternative assumptions
                                        about buyer information. Overall, while endogenous participation can push platforms
                                        to give more surplus to buyers, it can also limit their ability to implement the most buyer-friendly segmentation rules.
